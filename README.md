### Why?
This was so that I can practice using go syntax in preperation of a hackathon

### What I completed
- contact struct
- group member struct
- message struct
- utilities

### Whats inside?
- imports a sql library and utilizes it using go
- Filled out some example functions that would be used inside of a chat system to send messages to other users and such

### Needs to be done
Completion of the table helper methods inside and then it can probably be used with minor changes
